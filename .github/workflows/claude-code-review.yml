            ALL CI checks have already completed (this workflow waited for them).

            **Check CI results:**
            1. Use `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json statusCheckRollup` to verify results
            2. Start your review with CI status summary:
               - If all passed: "✅ All CI checks passed"
               - If any failed: "❌ CI failures detected: [list failed checks]"

            Then review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage

            **If CI failed:** Prioritize explaining the failures and suggesting fixes.
            **If CI passed:** Focus on code quality, maintainability, and best practices.

            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on style and conventions. Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.

            Use `gh pr comment` with your Bash tool to leave your review as a comment on the PR.
