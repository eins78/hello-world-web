# AI Agent Guidelines

_Vendor-neutral instructions for AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, etc.)_

## Key Rules

1. **Follow existing patterns** - Look at neighboring code before implementing
2. **Test everything** - Every feature needs unit tests AND E2E tests
3. **Document decisions** - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
4. **Keep it simple** - This is a demo project, avoid over-engineering
5. **Security first** - Even demos should follow security best practices

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Style

- Use 2-space indentation for all files
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Use type imports with the `type` keyword
- Use `type` for object shapes and primitives
- NEVER use enums - use simple string unions instead
- Prefer const assertions for literal types
- Prefer `type` over `interface` for object types

### Naming Conventions

- **Variables, parameters, functions**: camelCase
- **Classes, interfaces, types**: PascalCase
- **Constants**: UPPER_CASE
- **Files**: kebab-case for utilities, PascalCase for components/types
- **Folders**: kebab-case

### File Organization

- One export per file when possible
- Group related functionality in directories
- Use index.ts files to re-export from directories
- Keep files focused and under 300 lines when possible
- Routes go in `/src/routes/` with subdirectories for organization
- Types go in `/src/types/` as separate files
- Unit tests are colocated as `*.test.ts` files
- E2E tests go in `/packages/e2e-tests/`
- Feature docs go in `/docs/features/`

## Commit Messages

```
feat: add calendar subscription endpoint

Implements RFC 5545 compliant iCalendar feed to test
client compatibility across different calendar apps.

Fixes #123
```

- First line: `<type>: <description>` (lowercase, â‰¤72 chars)
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`
- Body: Explain WHY the change was made
- Reference issues with `Fixes #123` or `Relates to #123`
- Create feature branches as `feat/feature-name`
- If GPG issues: `git commit --no-gpg-sign -m "message"`

## Documentation Standards

1. Every module should include JSDoc comments for all exported functions, classes, and interfaces
2. Include parameter descriptions, return type descriptions, and examples
3. Document thrown exceptions
4. Update relevant documentation when changing functionality

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test files should be colocated with source files as `*.test.ts`
- ALWAYS use Node.js built-in test runner (not Jest, Vitest, etc.)
- Focus on testing business logic and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior

### E2E Tests

- Located in `/packages/e2e-tests/`
- Use Cypress for browser automation
- Test user flows and integration between components
- Include visual regression tests where appropriate

## Error Handling

1. Use descriptive error messages
2. Include context in error messages
3. Prefer explicit error handling over try-catch for expected errors
4. Log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive information

## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing or writing code, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows the established patterns in the codebase
- [ ] New features include appropriate tests
- [ ] Documentation is updated where necessary
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Error cases are handled appropriately
- [ ] Security considerations have been addressed

## Dependencies

**ALWAYS prefer built-in Node.js modules over external packages**

When adding dependencies:
1. Justify why it's needed in the PR
2. Pin exact version (no ^ or ~)
3. Check bundle size impact
4. Verify license compatibility

Example justification:
```
Adding ical-generator@9.0.0:
- Needed for RFC 5545 compliant calendar generation
- No suitable Node.js built-in alternative
- MIT licensed, 45KB minified
```

## Demo Development Process

### When Adding New Demo Features
1. ALWAYS create feature documentation first in `/docs/features/`
2. ALWAYS implement types before implementation in `/src/types/`
3. ALWAYS add both unit tests and E2E tests
4. ALWAYS link new demos from the homepage
5. ALWAYS test with multiple browsers/clients
6. ALWAYS document vendor-specific workarounds

### Demo Requirements Checklist
- [ ] Single concept focus (one demo = one feature)
- [ ] Live interactive demo at `/demos/<feature>`
- [ ] API endpoint documented with curl examples
- [ ] Client compatibility table in docs
- [ ] Links to official specs (RFC, W3C, etc.)
- [ ] E2E tests covering happy path + edge cases
- [ ] Vendor workarounds documented with examples

## Security Considerations

- Never expose sensitive information in demos
- Use placeholder data for examples
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web security
- Document any intentional security simplifications for demo purposes
