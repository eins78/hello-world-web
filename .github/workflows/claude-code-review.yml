            **STEP 1: Wait for CI checks to complete (max 30 minutes)**

            Implement this wait loop:
            1. Run: `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json statusCheckRollup`
            2. Parse the JSON output
            3. Count checks by status:
               - COMPLETED (with conclusion: success/failure/skipped)
               - IN_PROGRESS
               - PENDING (not started yet)
            4. Exclude this workflow (claude-review) and renovate-review from wait checks
            5. If ALL other checks are COMPLETED → proceed to STEP 1.5
            6. If not complete:
               - Run: `sleep 30` (wait 30 seconds)
               - Increment counter (track total wait time)
               - Repeat from step 1
            7. Maximum: 60 iterations (30 minutes total)
            8. After 30 min OR when complete → proceed to STEP 1.5

            **STEP 1.5: Collapse previous Claude comments (CRITICAL)**

            Before posting a new review, collapse any existing comments from previous runs:

            1. Get existing Claude comments:
               ```bash
               gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json comments \
                 --jq '.comments[] | select(.author.login == "claude" or .author.login == "claude-code-bot") | {id: .id, body: .body, createdAt: .createdAt}'
               ```
               This returns an array like: `[{id: 123456, body: "...", createdAt: "2025-11-30T10:00:00Z"}]`

            2. If comments exist:
               a. Get the MOST RECENT comment (last in the list)
               b. Extract the numeric 'id' field (e.g., 123456)
               c. Check if it's already wrapped in <details> (grep for "<details>")
               d. If NOT already wrapped:
                  - Wrap the body in:
                    ```
                    <details>
                    <summary>⏳ Outdated review (superseded by new push)</summary>

                    [original body]

                    _Review from [createdAt]_
                    </details>
                    ```
                  - IMPORTANT: Use the numeric 'id' field from JSON, NOT the node_id
                  - Update via: gh api -X PATCH /repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/comments/{numeric_id} -f body="[wrapped]"
                  - Ensure proper JSON escaping of body content

            3. Continue to STEP 2 (post new comment)

            **Benefits:**
            - Keeps thread clean (only latest expanded)
            - Preserves history (collapsed comments still accessible)
            - Shows timestamp on collapsed reviews

            **STEP 2: Review with CI results**

            Start your review with CI status summary:
            - If all passed: "✅ All CI checks passed (waited X min)"
            - If any failed: "❌ CI failures detected: [list failed checks]"
            - If timeout: "⏳ CI incomplete after 30 min: [list pending checks]"

            Then review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage

            **If CI failed:** Prioritize explaining the failures and suggesting fixes.
            **If CI passed:** Focus on code quality, maintainability, and best practices.
            **If CI incomplete:** Note which checks are pending/slow.
