            **STEP 1: Wait for CI checks to complete (max 30 minutes)**

            Implement this wait loop:
            1. Run: `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json statusCheckRollup`
            2. Parse the JSON output
            3. Count checks by status:
               - COMPLETED (with conclusion: success/failure/skipped)
               - IN_PROGRESS
               - PENDING (not started yet)
            4. Exclude this workflow (claude-review) and renovate-review from wait checks
            5. If ALL other checks are COMPLETED → proceed to STEP 2
            6. If not complete:
               - Run: `sleep 30` (wait 30 seconds)
               - Increment counter (track total wait time)
               - Repeat from step 1
            7. Maximum: 60 iterations (30 minutes total)
            8. After 30 min OR when complete → proceed to STEP 2

            **STEP 2: Review with CI results**

            Start your review with CI status summary:
            - If all passed: "✅ All CI checks passed (waited X min)"
            - If any failed: "❌ CI failures detected: [list failed checks]"
            - If timeout: "⏳ CI incomplete after 30 min: [list pending checks]"

            Then review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage

            **If CI failed:** Prioritize explaining the failures and suggesting fixes.
            **If CI passed:** Focus on code quality, maintainability, and best practices.
            **If CI incomplete:** Note which checks are pending/slow.
