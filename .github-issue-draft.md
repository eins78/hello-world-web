# @lit-labs/ssr incompatible with @lit/reactive-element 2.1.x - breaks SSR


`@lit-labs/ssr@3.3.1` depends on `@lit/reactive-element@^2.0.4`, but `lit@3.3.1` depends on `@lit/reactive-element@^2.1.0`. 

```
❯ npm info @lit-labs/ssr@3.3.1 'dependencies[@lit/reactive-element]'
^2.0.4

❯ npm info lit@3.3.1 'dependencies[@lit/reactive-element]'
^2.1.0
```

This installed both versions for my test app, which broke SSR:

```
TypeError: this._$EU is not a function
    at AppShell.update (.../node_modules/@lit/reactive-element/src/reactive-element.ts:1589:10)
    at LitElementRenderer.connectedCallback (.../node_modules/@lit-labs/ssr/src/lib/lit-element-renderer.ts:113:41)
```

I could work around this by forcing version `2.0.4`, this made all SSR tests pass. Forcing to version `2.1.1` did not work (it broke client-side hydration).

```json
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "@lit/reactive-element": "2.0.4"
  }
}
```

## Environment
- lit: 3.3.1
- @lit-labs/ssr: 3.3.1
- @lit/reactive-element: Both 2.0.4 and 2.1.1 installed (before the override)
- Package manager: pnpm 10.13.1
- Node: 22.17.1
